        {
          question: "What do you do when neighbors call with garage door problems?",
          answer: "We treat every call like it's coming from family. Whether it's a spring that snapped at midnight, a door that won't close leaving your home vulnerable, or an opener that died in a storm - we bring everything needed to fix it right the first time. From emergency repairs to beautiful new installations, we're here for whatever your family needs."
        },
        {
          question: "How fast will you come when our garage door breaks?",
          answer: "We know how stressful it is when your door breaks - you can't get to work, your home isn't secure, or you're worried about safety. That's why we prioritize getting to you as quickly as possible. When you call, you're not just another appointment - you're a neighbor who needs help, and we'll be there."
        },
        {
          question: "Will I get surprised by hidden costs after you arrive?",
          answer: "Never. We understand you're already stressed about the broken door - the last thing you need is surprise charges. Before we touch anything, we'll show you exactly what's wrong, explain your options in plain English, and give you honest upfront pricing. No surprises, no pressure, just straight answers."
        },
        {
          question: "What if something goes wrong after you fix my door?",
          answer: "We stand behind our work with a 10-year warranty because we use premium parts and expert installation. But more than that - we're your neighbors. If you ever have concerns, just call. We want you to feel completely confident that your family is safe and your door will work perfectly for years to come."
        },
        {
          question: "What if you can't fix my specific garage door brand?",
          answer: "In 15+ years serving Northern NJ families, we've never met a garage door we couldn't fix. Whether it's a LiftMaster, Chamberlain, Genie, or that old door from 1985 that 'no one makes parts for anymore' - we find a way. Our trucks are stocked with parts for every major brand, and if we don't have it, we'll get it."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I just fix the broken spring myself to save money?",
          answer: "Please don't risk it. These springs hold 400+ pounds of tension - we've seen too many neighbors get seriously hurt trying DIY repairs. Your safety and your family's peace of mind are worth more than saving a few dollars. We'll fix it safely, quickly, and with a warranty that protects you for 10 years."
